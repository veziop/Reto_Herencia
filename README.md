## Project info
There are four classes: Serie, Videjuego, Entregable and Interfaz. Each class is defined in its own .py file. The 
information flow is defined in ```main.py``` 
<br><br>
The first two classes inherit from Entregable, since they share a lot of code. Their differences are defined seperately.
Finally, the interface class Interfaz acts as a link, modifying the objects in <em>main.py</en> in a polymorphism way.
